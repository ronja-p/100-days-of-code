# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 28, 2022

**Today's Topic**: CSS Animations

- Streamed my progress on Twitch
- Completed freeCodeCamp lessons on CSS animations
- Followed YouTube tutorials for typewriter animations
- Worked with keyframes rules, variables and pseudo elements
- Added working typewriter animation to my portfolio website

**Thoughts:** I struggled to apply the tutorial in my existing project while streaming and needed time to myself to rethink my approach. In the end I couldn't complete my original ambitious idea but I still found a way to implement it that felt satisfying.

### Day 2: March 1, 2022

**Today's Topic:** Responsive CSS

- Streamed on Twitch
- Completed freeCodeCamp lesson on responsive CSS
- Watched Kevin Powell's videos on min(), max(), clamp() and on some key principles to keep your CSS responsive
- Started Kevin Powell's course on responsive CSS
- Started adjusting layout and font-size in my portfolio using what I learned but I didn't complete enough of it to commit

**Thoughts:** I thought I understood the topics but when I went to apply them to my portfolio I really struggled. I feel like I need to plan my days better ahead of time in order to avoid unnecessary tangents.

### Day 3: March 2, 2023

**Today's Topics:** em & rem, next.js

- Completed Day 2 of Conquering Responsive Layouts, learned about the differences between em and rem units in CSS, and why you should avoid using ems for font-sizes.
- Read a blog post about getting started with Next.js.
- Created my own Next app, followed a crash course, learned about pages, and started styling a navbar using modular css.

**Thoughts:** It was difficult to find a direction for the day, but once I got started with Next and realised how easy it was to get started it motivated me to keep going.

### Day 4: March 3, 2023

**Today's Topics:** next.js redirects, custom 404s, and layout

- Added custom 404 page to my next project which redirects to the home page.
- Explored built in redirects in next, opted for a useEffect on my 404 page instead.
- Created a layout with my navbar and wrapped my app in this layout.
- Tidied up Head component, explored difference between _app and _document.

**Thoughts:** I was confused about which type of redirect best suited my needs. Most examples of custpm 404s didn't redirect automatically, and the ones that did weren't the cleanest looking solutions. In the end I'm still loading an empty 404 page before redirecting back to home, whcih feels like it could be optimised further. Layouts seem fun, I'm looking forward to developing mine further.
