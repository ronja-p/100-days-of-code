# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 28, 2022

**Today's Topic**: CSS Animations

- Streamed my progress on Twitch
- Completed freeCodeCamp lessons on CSS animations
- Followed YouTube tutorials for typewriter animations
- Worked with keyframes rules, variables and pseudo elements
- Added working typewriter animation to my portfolio website

**Thoughts:** I struggled to apply the tutorial in my existing project while streaming and needed time to myself to rethink my approach. In the end I couldn't complete my original ambitious idea but I still found a way to implement it that felt satisfying.
