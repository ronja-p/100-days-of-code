# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 28, 2022

**Today's Topic**: CSS Animations

- Streamed my progress on Twitch
- Completed freeCodeCamp lessons on CSS animations
- Followed YouTube tutorials for typewriter animations
- Worked with keyframes rules, variables and pseudo elements
- Added working typewriter animation to my portfolio website

**Thoughts:** I struggled to apply the tutorial in my existing project while streaming and needed time to myself to rethink my approach. In the end I couldn't complete my original ambitious idea but I still found a way to implement it that felt satisfying.

### Day 2: March 1, 2022

**Today's Topic**: Responsive CSS

- Streamed on Twitch
- Completed freeCodeCamp lesson on responsive CSS
- Watched Kevin Powell's videos on min(), max(), clamp() and on some key principles to keep your CSS responsive
- Started Kevin Powell's course on responsive CSS
- Started adjusting layout and font-size in my portfolio using what I learned but I didn't complete enough of it to commit

**Thoughts:** I thought I understood the topics but when I went to apply them to my portfolio I really struggled. I feel like I need to plan my days better ahead of time in order to avoid unnecessary tangents.
